- In this video, I want to introduce you to React. React is a JavaScript library for building out user interfaces. In this course, you will learn more about the concepts I mentioned here while building a fun Notes application.
- With React, it's very common to build out single page applications. Components are what make up the visual layer of our application. With the addition of React hooks, the trend is shifting more towards functional components. Using a React router is how we can have multiple pages in a single page application.
- A React component has a lifecycle that it goes through. Understanding this will help you understand and make sense of how React builds and updates our DOM. Hooks are functions that allow us to hook into and manage state. The Key Prop should be unique and helps React identify which items have been changed.
- Common Commands There are three main commands you will use in every project. We have the Create React App command which creates the boilerplate files for a React application application. Also have the Run Build command that builds a directory for a production build of our app for deployment.
